        One of my biggest hobbies has always been fishing. The three types
        <br>
         of fishing that I do are listed above, bass, salmon, and trout fishing.
        <br>
        Spending time with my uncles and brothers and just removing myself from the
        <br>
        stress of everything going on makes it so fun and relaxing.
